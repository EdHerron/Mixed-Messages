A Codecademy project
--------------------

### The Concept ###
The idea here is to provide random elements that when added together create a random meal.

### Execution ###
We used arrays to store the possible options then a function to randomly pick an element to pull from the array.

After that, we simply console.log a short sentence using string concatenation to bring it all together.

Simply run the program to see the results!
